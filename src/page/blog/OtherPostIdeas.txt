Technology:
- Programming with first-class Datalog constraints
- Linting
- Null
- Type-level booleans
- Complexity annotations
- How we track Flix compiler performance
- Currying the right way and the wrong way?

Reflections:
- No Free Lunch (Simple or well-engineered)
- Sanity-- (e.g. in the style of PHP - a fractal of bad design).
- Negativity around PL design
